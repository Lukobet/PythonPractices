# Arthimetic Operations supported in Python
## there are addition, subtraction, multiplication and division is into 2
print(10 / 3)
#the answer will be a floating number i.e decimal numbers 
#but to get an integer use double slash (//)
print(10 // 3)

print(10 % 3)

print(10 ** 3) #raise to power 3

# more examples
x = 10
x = x + 3
print(x)
# more examples for orgumented assignment operator
x = 10
x += 3
print(x)
# more examples for orgumented assignment operator
x = 10
x -= 3

# python goes in this order when solving : exponentiation 2 ** 2 , then multiplication or division then addition or subtraction. for examples:
x = 10 + 3 * 2 ** 2
print(x)
# again python goes in this order when solving : Parenthesis, exponentiation 2 ** 2 , then multiplication or division then addition or subtraction. for examples:
x = (10 + 3) * 2 ** 2
print(x)
# self practice
x = (2 + 3) * 10 - 3
